### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maksym from Ukraine and I am a motivated Front-End Developer willing to develop my skills and gain valuable experience in this field. As a student with 2 years of experience in website design, I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects.

Currently, I focus on learning new knowledge related to front-end development in order to expand my skillset and tackle new challenges. I typically use HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and I also have some experience with React.js.
