I am a second-year software engineering student and future front-end web developer. By now, I have gained a solid foundation in JavaScript through various courses, self-study, and university. I am currently expanding my skillset to build modern, user-friendly websites. Now I use HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and I also have some familiarity with React.js.

I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects and collaborate with experienced developers. I would love to hear from you if you are looking for a motivated and aspiring front-end developer or JavaScript intern.

*Description: The game has two players, and each player takes turns rolling a dice. The player accumulates points for each roll, and can choose to "hold" and keep their points or "roll" again to try to accumulate more points. If a player rolls a "1" on the dice, they lose all their points for that turn and the next player takes their turn. The first player who reaches 100 points wins the game.*
