# Maksym Romanyshak
I am a second-year software engineering student and future front-end web developer. By now, I have gained a solid foundation in JavaScript through various courses, self-study, and university. I am currently expanding my skillset to build modern, user-friendly websites. I mostly use HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, I have experience working with React and Node.js, and I also have some familiarity with Express.

I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects and collaborate with experienced developers. I would love to hear from you if you are looking for a motivated and aspiring front-end developer or JavaScript intern.

## Skills and Experience:
* 💻 HTML/CSS & JavaScript
* 📚 English - B1 (Intermediate)

## Projects
### [Guess My Number ❓](https://github.com/MaksymRomanyshak/GuessMyNumber)
Description: Simple web game. The goal is to guess a secret number which is between 1 and 20.
### [Modal](https://github.com/MaksymRomanyshak/Modal)
Description: This is a JavaScript simple UI component that creates a modal window that can be opened and closed with buttons, as well as by pressing the 'Escape' key or clicking outside the modal window.
### [Pig Game 🎲](https://github.com/MaksymRomanyshak/PigGame)
Description: The game has two players, and each player takes turns rolling a dice. The player accumulates points for each roll, and can choose to "hold" and keep their points or "roll" again to try to accumulate more points. If a player rolls a "1" on the dice, they lose all their points for that turn and the next player takes their turn. The first player who reaches 100 points wins the game.
